                <h2>History of Web Browsers</h2>
                <p>In 1990, the World Wide Web was the first browser created by W3C Director Tim Berners-Lee. 
                    The Web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1993 the Web grew rapidly, Universities, governments, and private corporations all saw opportunity in the open internet. In the same year <b>Mosaic</b>
                    became known a the most popular web browser.
                    The leader of the Mosaic team, Marc Andreessen, released <b>Netscape</b> soon after in 1994. The release of the <b>Internet Explorer</b> from <b>Microsoft</b>
                    in 1995, led to a browser war.
                </p>
                <h3>The Browser war</h3>
                <p>
                    Netscape and Microsoft competed with each other by making faster and better versions of their products.
                    Netscape created and released <b>JavaScript</b>, which gave websites powerful computing capabilities they never had before.
                    Microsoft responded with the release of <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b>, which became the standard for web page design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other competitors emerged during the late â€˜90s and early 2000s, including Google Chrome and Safari. 
                    Microsoft Edge replaced Internet Explorer with the release of Windows 10 in 2015.
