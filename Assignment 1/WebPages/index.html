            <h2>History of Web Browsers</h2>
            <p>In 1990, the World Wide Web was the first browser created by W3C Director Tim Berners-Lee. 
                The Web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world.
                In 1993 the Web grew rapidly, Universities, governments, and private corporations all saw opportunity in the open internet. In the same year Mosaic
                became known a the most popular web browser.
                The leader of the Mosaic team, Marc Andreessen, released Netscape soon after in 1994. The release of the Internet Explorer from Microsoft
                in 1995, led to a browser war.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Browser war</h3>
            <p>
                Netscape and Microsoft competed with each other by making faster and better versions of their products.
                Netscape created and released JavaScript, which gave websites powerful computing capabilities they never had before.
                Microsoft responded with the release of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which became the standard for web page design.
                Other competitors emerged during the late ‘90s and early 2000s, including Google Chrome and Safari. Microsoft Edge replaced Internet Explorer with the release of Windows 10 in 2015.
