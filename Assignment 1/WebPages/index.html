                <h2>History of Web Browsers</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1990, the World Wide Web was the first browser created by W3C Director Tim Berners-Lee. 
                    The Web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1993 the Web grew rapidly, Universities, governments, and private corporations all saw opportunity in the open internet. In the same year <strong>Mosaic</strong>
                    became known a the most popular web browser.
                    The leader of the Mosaic team, Marc Andreessen, released <strong>Netscape</strong> soon after in 1994. The release of the <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> from <strong>Microsoft</strong>
                    in 1995, led to a browser war.
                </p>
                <h3>The Browser war</h3>
                <p>
                    Netscape and Microsoft competed with each other by making faster and better versions of their products.
                    Netscape created and released <strong>JavaScript</strong>, which gave websites powerful computing capabilities they never had before.
                    Microsoft responded with the release of <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong>, which became the standard for web page design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other competitors emerged during the late â€˜90s and early 2000s, including Google Chrome and Safari. 
                    Microsoft Edge replaced Internet Explorer with the release of Windows 10 in 2015.

                <h2>Function of web browsers</h2>
                <p>
                    The purpose of a web browser is to fetch information resources from the Web and display them on a user's device.
                    The primary function of a web browser is to render <strong>HTML</strong>, the code used to design or "mark up" webpages. 
                    Each time a browser loads a web page, it processes the HTML, which may include text, links, and references to images and other items, such as <strong>cascading style sheets </strong>and <strong>Javascript</strong> functions
                    The browser processes these items, then renders them in the browser window.
                </p>
