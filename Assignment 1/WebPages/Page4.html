                <h3> History of the Safari web browser</h3>
                <p>The very first version of safari was published on the 23rd of june in 2003. It has gone trough several updates since then, 
                    from Safari 1.0 to the new current Safari 14.
                </p>
                <p>The Safari web browser is also available for Windows machines, but Apple has stop making updates for it after the 5.17 version (released in May 2012)

                <h3> Safari on windows</h3>
                <p>The Safari web browser was also available for Windows machines, until Apple decided to stop making updates for them after the 5.17 version, that was released in May 2012. <br>
                    What could have been the reasons for Apple to discontinue the Safari updates for Windows? Afterall it's a huge market that Apple could have profited on.
                    While their true reasons still remains hidden, we can speculate some explantions for it.
                </p>

                <p>Firstly a possible explantion for it, is that the browser's low market share on Windows may not have justified the cost of maintaining and supporting a Windows' version of Safari.
                    Safari was very buggy for Windows and didn't look like a Windows program at all.
                    <br>
                    Another problem was that Windows users were freely able to choose any web browsers they liked. Apple was mostly focued on designing the Safari web browser for 
                    Apple devices, Safari for Windows was only their second thought. The introudction of Google Chrome, which prioritized support for Windows machines, may have led to the downfall of Safari for Windows, because
                    Apple knew they simply couldn't compete with it.
