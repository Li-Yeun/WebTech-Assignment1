                <h3> History of the Safari web browser</h3>
                <p>The very first version of safari was launched on the 23rd of june in 2003. It has gone trough several updates since then, 
                    from Safari 1.0 to the new current Safari 14. <br>
                    In this section we will briefly descripe the most important feautures of each update.
                </p>

                <p>Beginning with Safari 1.0, Steve Jobs announced in 2003 that Apple had developed its own web browser, called Safari.
                    It was based on Apple's internal fork of the KHTML rendering engine, called WebKit. Their first version version of the web browser was very primitive, 
                    with a limited amount of features and a lot of bugs. The second version of Safari was released to fix some specific bugs in Safari, it has passed
                    the Acid2 test by doing so, and was also the first web browser that had passed this test.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On Janurary 9, 2007, Steve Jobs announced the IPhone, The OS of the phone used a mobile version of the Safari web browser
                    and was able to display full, desktop-class website. This was introduced as Safari 3.0.     
                    
                    In safari 4.0 support for HTML5 and CSS was added. Safari 5.0 further improved support for HTML5 further and introduced a new Safari Reader
                    for reading articles on the web without distraction, and a 30% Javascript performance increase over Safari 4.

                    In 2012 Apple released the Safari 6.0 with a feature called iCloud Tabs, which allows users to sync their open tabs with any
                    iOS or other OS X devices.                  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Safari 7.0 brought improvements in Javascript performance and memory usage. Safari 8.0 added WebGL support, and in Safari 9.0
                    you were able to mute and pin tabs.

                <h3> Safari on windows</h3>
                <p>The Safari web browser was also available for Windows machines, until Apple decided to stop making updates for them after the 5.17 version, that was released in May 2012. <br>
                    What could have been the reasons for Apple to discontinue the Safari updates for Windows? Afterall it's a huge market that Apple could have profited on.
                    While their true reasons still remains hidden, we can speculate some explantions for it.
                </p>

                <p>Firstly a possible explantion for it, is that the browser's low market share on Windows may not have justified the cost of maintaining and supporting a Windows' version of Safari.
                    Safari was very buggy for Windows and didn't look like a Windows program at all.
                    <br>
                    Another problem was that Windows users were freely able to choose any web browsers they liked. Apple was mostly focued on designing the Safari web browser for 
                    Apple devices, Safari for Windows was only their second thought. The introudction of Google Chrome, which prioritized support for Windows machines, may have led to the downfall of Safari for Windows, because
                    Apple knew they simply couldn't compete with it.
